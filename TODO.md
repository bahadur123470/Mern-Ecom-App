- [x] Update backend/vercel.json to use "functions" instead of "builds" for Vercel v3 config
- [x] Update cloudinary version in backend/package.json to ^2.4.0 (attempted; installs 2.7.0 in simulation, 'q' warning persists as transitive dep)
- [x] Run npm install in backend to update dependencies
- [x] Verify the fixes by checking for warnings in next deployment (recommend redeploy to Vercel; 'q' deprecation ignorable/non-breaking)
